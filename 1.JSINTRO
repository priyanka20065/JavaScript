    first netscape navigator was released in 1994 .brendan eich created javascript in 1995 within 10 days.it was first called mocha then livescript and finally javascript.

    in 1996 microsoft released jscript with internet explorer 3.0. in 1997 ecma international published the first edition of ecmascript. 

    es1:1997 netscape submitted javascript to ecma international for standardization. the result was ecmascript 1 in june 1997. it was based on javascript and jscript. the latest version of ecmascript is ecmascript 11 released in 2020.

    es6: ecmascript 6 was released in 2015. it is also known as es6 or es2015. it is a major update to the language. it added many new features to the language. it is the first major update to the language since es5 which was released in 2009.

    members of tc39 committee are responsible for the development of ecmascript. tc39 stands for technical committee 39. it is a group of people who are responsible for the development of ecmascript.

    es6:es2015 is a major update to the language. it added many new features to the language. it is the first major update to the language since es5 which was released in 2009.

    es7:es2016 was released in 2016. it is a minor update to the language. it added two new features to the language. it is the second minor update to the language since es6 which was released in 2015.

    es8:es2017 was released in 2017. it is a minor update to the language. it added many new features to the language. it is the third minor update to the language since es6 which was released in 2015.


    javascript is backward compatible. this means that newer versions of the language can run on older versions of the language. this is because the newer versions of the language are based on the older versions of the language.

    babel is a tool that can be used to convert es6 code to es5 code. this is useful because not all browsers support es6 code. babel can be used to convert es6 code to es5 code so that it can run on all browsers.

Short truth (but explained properly)

👉 No, not using ; will NOT give an error,
👉 even if you use "use strict".

//template string
//template string is a string that can contain placeholders
//template string is enclosed in backticks

let name="john";
let str18="my name is "+name+" and i am "+age+" years old";

and when we use template string we can use multi line string and it will print in the same format as we write it in the code and when we use " " or ' ' then we have to use \n to print in the next line

let firstName = "Rakesh"; is String primitive, this is Immutable, these are Stored in the Memory directly.
where as 
let firstName = new String("Rakesh"); is String Object, this is Mutable, this not Efficient for Memory Management when compare to String Primitives.
